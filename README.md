Draft Application Idea:
Personal Task Manager app that allows users to manage their day-to-day activities, whether it's work-related or hobbies, any task/event can be stored in the application. The app would receive input such as the name of the task, which days and at what time the task occurs, and a short description of the event and its importance level. 

The app will likely notify a user of an upcoming task, but at most, the app should be able to display an organized schedule of the user's days. 

Users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks directly within the app and the database will create, update, and delete that data according to what the user chooses to do.

We plan on designing a user-friendly interface that is simple, easy to use, and easy to understand how to navigate. We would like to add more features to the app but that's what we have for now.

An advanced element we spoke about adding it sending notifications to the user so they become better at managing their time.

We want to allow users the option to add in monthly, yearly, or even weekly goals that they will aim to achieve. There are levels to the tasks they can add. They can set priority levels of importance or even build up small goals throughout the day to achieve their largest ambitions.
